# The reversal band instability at kinetic level
## To do the reversal numerical simulations: (Old version)
1. Generate a band state at a small systems in 2 systems with various reversal rate.
2. Copy the profile (or distribution) of the band state to the rectangular system (long band) to see the dynamics of the instability.

## Note:
1. The band instability changes with reversal rate using micro-SPR model.
2. The typical 2 sub-classes of band instability do not change with the 
reversal rate when the interaction potential is chosen.
